    <h1>Wesley Wild</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! 
        I’m a computer science major at the 
        University of Central Florida. 
        I’m primarily interested in game development 
        and machine learning. 
        This website is a portfolio of the work 
        I’ve done, work I’m doing, 
        and work I plan on doing. 
        I hope you enjoy!
    </p>

    <h3>Professional Writing Class Assignments</h3>
    <h4>Ollie Instructions</h5>
    <p>
        For my professional writing class, I was assigned to make instructions. 
        I choose to write about how to ollie, since I skateboard often 
        and have spent a lot of time learning and improving at the trick.
        In this document, I communicated my ideas clearly, 
        which is a useful skill for working with a team and brainstorming.
        I also was able to communicate complex processes, 
        which I did mainly by breaking the task down into manageable steps
        such as the one shown below.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/images/example1.png" 
                    alt="Steps Example"
                    height="200"
                    class="center-image"
        >
    </div>
    <p>
        When writing these steps I focused on the user, 
        which is an important skill for when designing software 
        that needs to be beginner or user friendly.
        One of the ways I did this was through writing common mistakes as shown below,
        many of which I made when first learning how to ollie.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/images/example2.png" 
                    alt="Steps Example"
                    height="100"
                    class="center-image"
        >
    </div>
    <p>
        These common mistakes sections also show my attention to detail
        in combating problems the reader might face.
        This is similar to debugging and optimizing code 
        where it helps to cover potential problems in the future and think about corner cases.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>
        Currently involved in researching reinforcement learning. 
        I have been working with other ungraduates and 
        a grad student to learn more about machine learning.
        We have been learning the basics and implmenting other's code to understand
        topics such as a Markov Decision Process and python libraries such as PyTorch and MatPlotLib.
    </p>
    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p>
        In the future I plan on participating in more hackathons and
        game jams along with making personal projects 
        such as this website and my own games.
